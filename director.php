              <p>India is one of the leading countries to address the current challenges in higher education through the formulation of the "National Education Policy 2020".

              India is the first Country in the World to provide Faculty Certification through the creation of 8 modules associated with Pedagogy, Research, Leadership, Technology, Professional Ethics, and Evaluation. This innovative model has immense potential to attract other developing and developed Countries to follow our footsteps.
